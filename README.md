# PC to E3V2 Screen
This project is just researching about the Ender 3 V2 Screen, and see if I can use it as a in-case display

> [!NOTE]
> At the start of this project, I know nothing about the possibilities of it and i'm just gonna write my researches here.

# What's the screen ?
The screen comes from the Ender 3 V2, it's a 3D printer. On the chip there's wrote **"T7 2142"**, I find nothing on the web for it.
And there's also the pinout wrote directly on the PCB.

# How?
So, while going into the [Mriscoc Ender 3 V2 screen firmware](https://github.com/mriscoc/Ender3V2S1/), I found out that there's multiple "types" of screens, and mine's a **"TJC display"**
Show at the screenshot below :
